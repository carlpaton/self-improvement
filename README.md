# Self Improvement

This is a space outside of my normal blog posts at https://carlpaton.github.io/ because these are notes mostly based on books, podcasts and online articles. I by no means wish to plagiarise anybodys work so will citate the source of the information in the mark down files.

The repository is part of my own desire and effort to improve myself based on learnings from others, its about being the best version of yourself so you can contribute towards making the world a better place.
